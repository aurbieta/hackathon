Python or Java knowledge is required to fulfill the following tasks (it´s your decision!).

## Configure an MQTT Broker 

The first task involves installing and configuring an MQTT Broker such as [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/). 

 * Download and configure mosquitto with at least **password** authentication. 
 * Test that your Edge node connects and that it´s able to send/receive messages. 
 
## Store sensor data in a Time Series Database 

 * Install a time series database such as [InfluxDB](https://portal.influxdata.com/downloads/)
 * Develop a program that stores data received on the broker on the Time Series database:
    * You can use whatever you want (python script / Java program, etc) to develop a small program.
    * Another option is to use [Telegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/) with its MQTT consumer [plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/mqtt_consumer)

## Develop a REST API capable of getting data stored on the Time Series Database

 * Develop a small REST API that is able to extract data from the Time Series Database, two options:
   * [Springboot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
   * [Flask](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
 * Use a tool like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/) to test the API. 

## Develop a Dashboard in order to be able to see incoming data

 * Install and configure [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) in order to develop on top of it an easy visualization of the incoming data (develop a Grafana ```dashboard```). 

## Real Time processing of incoming data

 * First install and configure a relational database such as [MySql](https://www.mysql.com/) or [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).
 * Then develop a small program that makes stores and fire an alarm on the relational database when a sensor data is above a given threshold. 
 * Use a program that connects to the database (e.g. [DBVeaber](https://dbeaver.io/)) for showing that your program works.

## Make machine learning model using the historical data stored in the time series database

 * See ```ml``` folder for further instructions.

## Use Docker and docker-compose to Dockerize your solution 

 * See ```docker``` folder for further instructions.
